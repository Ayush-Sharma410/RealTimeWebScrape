1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install Selenium using pip:

3. Download the appropriate web driver for your browser:
- Chrome: [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
- Firefox: [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

4. Add the web driver executable to your system's PATH.

### Puppeteer

To install and set up Puppeteer for web scraping, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. Initialize a new Node.js project (if not already initialized):

3. Install Puppeteer as a dependency:

## Usage

To use the web scraping methods with Selenium and Puppeteer, follow these steps:
